Dependency on UIAutomation.dll is compiled by default into executables produced by Delphi 13 as well as some other compilers. Windows XP and Windows 2003 won't have this DLL available in system32 unless .NET 3.5 is installed. ReactOS won't have this DLL available and .NET 3.5 can't be installed onto it. Without the DLL present, the Delphi executable will fail to run and the app will not work, even after manually changing the PE Header version in Linking to allow the executable to run on legacy Windows.*

I've created a basic UIAutomation.dll using [Dummy DLL Generator](https://github.com/ykhwong/dummy-dll-generator]), adjusted the appropriate manifest details, and digitally signed it using the same Rare Ideas, LLC code signing certificate used by [PortableApps.com](https://portableapps.com/). This dll can be placed alongside your Delphi executable to allow it to work on Windows XP, Windows 2003, and ReactOS even without the .NET 3.5 installed.

## To Install

1. Download the UIAutomation.dll file from the [Releases section](https://github.com/JohnTHaller/UIAutomation-DLL-Helper/releases)
2. Place the DLL in the same directory as your Delphi executable
3. Profit!

## License

The DLL is licensed under the MIT license for compatibility with any release you'd like to use it with.

*** To set the PE version in Delphi 13 of a given project, click Project from the main menu, then select Options, expand Building, expand Delphi Compiler, expand Linking, then adjust the fields "Set OS Versdion fields in PE Header as..." and "Set Subsystem Version fields in PE Header as..." to 5.1. If you use System.Threading, you'll need to [tweak GetTickCount](https://en.delphipraxis.net/topic/5536-delphi-11-windows-xp-compatibility-tweak/).
